PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MySQL root USER !
To do so, start the server, then issue the following commands:

/usr/local/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password'
/usr/local/bin/mysqladmin -u root -h arsaripadi-gw.arsaripadi.com password 'new-password'

Alternatively you can run:
/usr/local/bin/mysql_secure_installation

which will also give you the option of removing the test
databases and anonymous user created by default.  This is
strongly recommended for production servers.

See the manual for more instructions.

You can start the MySQL daemon with:
/etc/rc.d/mysqld start

Please report any problems with the /usr/local/bin/mysqlbug script!
